    <h2>CHANGING THE FACE OF CANCER CHARITY DONATIONS FOREVER</h2><br><br>
  <hr>
   <p>When Terry Fox was diagnosed with osteosarcoma at 18, the experience ignited in him a fierce determination to bring an end to the suffering cancer causes. His personal experience and research led him to the conclusion that more money was needed for cancer research. And so, on April 12, 1980, Terry dipped his artificial leg in the Atlantic Ocean and proceeded to change the world.</p>

 <p>Terrance Stanley Fox CC OD was born July 28, 1958 in Winnipeg, Manitoba but raised in Port Coquitlam, a community near Vancouver, British Columbia, on Canada’s west coast. In high school he was a distance runner and basketball player at his Port Coquitlam high school, now named after him, and Simon Fraser University.</p>

  <p>In 1977, at age 18, after being diagnosed with osteosarcoma, his right leg was amputated, and he underwent 16 months of cancer treatment. Even with his right leg amputated, he continued to run using an artificial leg, as well as play wheelchair basketball in Vancouver, winning three national championships.</p>
 
<h3>“Anything's possible if you try.” – Terry Fox</h3>

  <p>While in cancer treatment, Terry found he could not ignore the suffering he witnessed in the cancer wards. He decided to run across Canada, from the east coast to the west, to raise money for cancer research in a Marathon of Hope. He wasn’t doing the run to become famous; he wanted to create change and fund a cure for all cancers. On April 12, 1980, he began his run with little fanfare in St John's, Newfoundland and Labrador, and ran the equivalent of a full marathon, close to 42 kilometres (26 miles) each day, through the Maritime provinces, Quebec and Ontario. He ran through snow, rain, wind, heat, humidity. He stopped in more than 400 towns, schools and cities to talk about why he was running. He started at 4:30am in the morning, and often did not finish his last mile until 7pm at night. Sometimes Terry and Doug, his best friend and driver, would sleep in the van because they could not afford a place to stay. </p>

<p>Some days hundreds of people cheered him on; other days he was alone on the road, and no money was raised. But Terry never gave up hope that Canadians would respond to his story, to his effort…and he was right. When Terry entered Ontario on June 28, 1980, the whole country was cheering him on and donating to cancer research. Canadians saw that Terry’s effort and determination was unlimited.</p>

<h3>“I am not a quitter!” – Terry Fox</h3>

  <p>Unfortunately, on September 1, 1980, after 143 days and 5,373 kilometres (3,339 miles), Terry was forced to stop running outside of Thunder Bay, Ontario. The only thing that could have stopped him did: cancer had reappeared, this time in his lungs. Even from Terry’s hospital bed, he continued to talk about the importance of donating to cancer research. He asked Canadians to continue to support his Marathon of Hope; he hoped his second diagnosis would help everyone understand that cancer could happen to anyone, even someone who had just raised over $1.7 million for research.</p>

  <p>Terry died on June 28, 1981, at the age 22, ten months later. This bold and courageous Canadian was gone, but his legacy was just beginning. To date, over $800 million has been raised for cancer research in Terry’s name through the annual Terry Fox Run, first held in September 1981, and now grown to involve millions of participants in over 60 countries and is now the world’s largest one-day fundraiser for cancer research held across Canada and around the world.</p>

<h3>“I want to set an example that will never be forgotten.” – Terry Fox</h3>

<p>Fox was the youngest person named a Companion of the Order of Canada and won the 1980 Lou Marsh Award as the nation's top sportsman. He was named Canada's Newsmaker of the Year in both 1980 and 1981 by The Canadian Press. Considered a national hero, he has had many buildings, statues, roads, and parks named in his honour across the country.</p>
